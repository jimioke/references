	Dcterms.Abstract = {(cont.) The attractiveness of a utility-based accessibility metric comes from its basis in welfare economics, its ability to account for individual characteristics and preferences, and the possibility for its derivation from the random utility-based models (e.g., logit), which have a long tradition of use in transportation planning. Also, drawing from the large research base exploring the role of the built environment on transportation, I develop several models that assess the influence of the built environment on travel behavior, in particular, motor vehicle ownership and use. These models, combined, enable the exploration of sustainable mobility within a given city. I apply the framework to the city of Santiago de Chile, utilizing data from a 2001 household travel survey and a 2001 real estate cadastre, specifying a nested destination and mode choice model, and examining a subset of discretionary trips by seven different travel modes. Variations by income, gender, and modal availability are explored. I conclude with a discussion of the implications in the face of current urban growth patterns in Santiago.},

@article{sugar2003finding,
	Abstract = { One of the most difficult problems in cluster analysis is identifying the number of groups in a dataset. Most previously suggested approaches to this problem are either somewhat ad hoc or require parametric assumptions and complicated calculations. In this article we develop a simple, yet powerful nonparametric method for choosing the number of clusters based on distortion, a quantity that measures the average distance, per dimension, between each observation and its closest cluster center. Our technique is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate empirically its effectiveness, not only for choosing the number of clusters, but also for identifying underlying structure, on a wide range of simulated and real world datasets. In addition, we give a rigorous theoretical justification for the method based on information-theoretic ideas. Specifically, results from the subfield of electrical engineering known as rate distortion theory allow us to describe the behavior of the distortion in both the presence and absence of clustering. Finally, we note that these ideas potentially can be extended to a wide range of other statistical model selection problems. },

@article{johnson1967hierarchical,
	Abstract = {Techniques for partitioning objects into optimally homogeneous groups on the basis of empirical measures of similarity among those objects have received increasing attention in several different fields. This paper develops a useful correspondence between any hierarchical system of such clusters, and a particular type of distance measure. The correspondence gives rise to two methods of clustering that are computationally rapid and invariant under monotonic transformations of the data. In an explicitly defined sense, one method forms clusters that are optimally ``connected,'' while the other forms clusters that are optimally ``compact.''},

@article{louf2014typology,
	Abstract = {We propose a quantitative method to classify cities according to their street pattern. We use the conditional probability distribution of shape factor of blocks with a given area and define what could constitute the {\textquoteleft}fingerprint{\textquoteright} of a city. Using a simple hierarchical clustering method, these fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a typology of cities. We apply this method to a set of 131 cities in the world, and at an intermediate level of the dendrogram, we observe four large families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. At a lower level of the classification, we find that most European cities and American cities in our sample fall in their own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively the differences between the typical layouts of cities in both regions. We also show with the example of New York and its different boroughs, that the fingerprint of a city can be seen as the sum of the ones characterizing the different neighbourhoods inside a city. This method provides a quantitative comparison of urban street patterns, which could be helpful for a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms behind their distinct shapes.},

@article{ma2013world,
	Abstract = {The research constitutes the first effort to test the claim found in the world city theoretical literature that, as world cities strengthen ties with each other, their linkages with their countries' hinterlands and national urban systems will weaken. This research offers a more nuanced exploration of this hypothesis by taking into account variation in the nature of the state across countries in which world cities are located as well as the source of global capital in the world cities. Specifically, the research reported here suggests that three types of world cities---market-centred bourgeois world cities (MWC), state-centred political bureaucratic world cities (SWC) and dual-role world cities (DWC)---entail different deterritorialisation outcomes. Three countries that have prototypical global cities---Japan (SWC), China (DWC) and the US (MWC) are compared, applying longitudinal network modelling to relational data on national city networks. From 1993 to 2007, more globally connected MWCs weakened their national ties. In contrast, higher global status has no significant effect on the integration of SWCs or DWCs with their national urban systems. This indicates that the type of state, but not the source of capital, conditions whether the world city will deterritorialise vis-{\`a}-vis its national city system.},

An important example is seen in origin-destination matrices, which contain the complete information on commuting flows, but are difficult to analyze and compare. We propose here a versatile method, which extracts a coarse-grained signature of mobility networks, under the form of a 2 ×2 matrix that separates the flows into four categories. We apply this method to origin-destination matrices extracted from mobile phone data recorded in 31 Spanish cities. We show that these cities essentially differ by their proportion of two types of flows: integrated (between residential and employment hotspots) and random flows, whose importance increases with city size. Finally, the method allows the determination of categories of networks, and in the mobility case, the classification of cities according to their commuting structure.},

  abstract = { In the context of the arrival of electric vehicles on the car market, new mathematical models are needed to understand and predict the impact on the market shares. This research provides a comprehensive methodology to forecast the demand of a technology that is not widespread yet, such as electric cars. It aims at providing contributions regarding three issues related to the prediction of the demand for electric vehicles: survey design, model estimation, and forecasting. We develop a stated preferences (SP) survey with personalized choice situations involving standard gasoline/diesel cars and electric cars. We specify a hybrid choice model accounting for attitudes toward leasing contracts or practical aspects of a car in the decision-making process. A forecasting analysis based on the collected SP data and additional market information is performed to evaluate the future demand for electric cars. },

  abstract  = {This thesis presents the design of a context-aware stated preference survey that will be used to estimate the demand for new transportation modes and services. It builds on the Future Mobility Survey, a smartphone-based prompted-recall survey that accurately gathers revealed preference information on respondents' travel patterns. By using this GPS data as the context for a hypothetical stated preference survey, we can present realistic travel scenarios to respondents that pivot off their actual behavior. The approach is the first of its kind to combine GPS and external data to generate hypothetical scenarios for a large number of modes. It does this by making use of freely available web services to gather information on travel times and distances on many modes, which then informs the presentation of these modes in the hypothetical scenario. The travel scenario is presented using a web interface that mimics trip-planning software, and the software can be readily applied across different cities and countries.},

  abstract = { The Future Mobility Survey (FMS) is a smartphone-based prompted-recall travel survey that aims to support data collection initiatives for transport-modeling purposes. This paper details the considerations that have gone into the survey's development, including the smartphone apps for iPhone and Android platforms, the online activity diary and user interface, and the background intelligence for processing collected data into activity locations and travel traces. The various trade-offs concerning user comprehension, resource use, and participant burden, including findings from usability tests and a pilot study, are discussed. Close attention should be paid to the simplicity of the user interaction, determinations of activity locations (such as the false positive and false negative trade-off in their automatic classification), and the clarity of interactions in the activity diary. The FMS system design and implementation provide pragmatic, useful insights into the development of similar platforms and approaches for travel and activity surveys. },

  abstract = { The culmination of new vehicle technology, greater competition in energy markets, and government policies to reduce pollution and energy consumption will result in changes to the personal vehicle marketplace. To measure future vehicle preferences, stated preference (SP) surveys have been the dominant approach. Prior research has been limited to a narrow focus of accelerating respondents' hypothetical next vehicle purchasing decisions without mimicking the influence of the marketplace on these decisions. To explore marketplace influences, this study proposes to use a novel SP survey design to analyze vehicle purchasing behavior in a dynamically changing marketplace through the use of dynamic attributes and a 6-year hypothetical time window. The survey is divided into three parts: household characteristics, current vehicles, and SP. The SP section presents respondents with various hypothetical scenarios annually over a future 6-year period with one of three experiments. The experiments correspond to changing vehicle technology, fueling options, and taxation policy. Between scenarios, the vehicle, fuel, and policy attributes dynamically change to mimic marketplace conditions. A pilot web-based survey was performed during fall 2010. Mixed logit models showed that individuals responded in behaviorally realistic ways and that the survey design allowed for estimation of important parameters in vehicle choice. Respondents were able to depreciate their vehicles over the 5-year hypothetical period and place trade-offs on the features of vehicles and fuel types. The insights from the survey are also used to suggest refinements to the survey methods and areas for further research. },
